The program is trying to determine which payment option is better (more money).
First option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The second option is 1 dollars
a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days. There will be two functions to calculate the pay rate.
funtion1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function2 will calculate the amount for the second option

funtion1 will output to 100 * 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times, with each time, doubling the amount and add the amount to the total.

if the amount is qual, we output to the user "Option 1 and option 2 are the same"
if the option1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if the option2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
